## About Me

I am a thoughtful nerd that is continually problem solving and looking for improvements. I’m well versed in all parts of web development and can work with multiple languages, platforms and back-ends to produce robust, optimized sites. I’ve developed websites for over two dozen years beginning with NT 3.51 and ASP using VBScript. I'm a tenacious debugger and analyze project needs to create elegant, forward-thinking solutions. Beyond programming, I have a broad variety of web-relevant skills including deep CSS familiarity and know how to make a performant website. I consider myself a good fit for a position that requires a flexible, agile programmer/fixer.

  Platform migrations, XML/XSLT, CSS3, HTML5, CFML, PHP and more
- Extensive experience with several programming languages and application platforms:<br>
  Node.js, PHP, Python, JavaScript, Java, XSLT, Visual Basic, VB Script, UML, SQL, and noSQL

## Experience
### Salem Academy and College
#### Webmaster, Migration Specialist (10/08 -Present)

- Maintained and enhanced www.salem.edu and www.salemacademy.com
- Used ClickHeat and Google AdSense to analyze the multiple dimensions of the site's usability and online presence. Using these tools we were able to gain the insight into what worked and what didn't. In the end we improved time spent on site by 20% and dropped the bounce rate by nearly 15%.
- Streamlined online media delivery including work with Flash Video and YouTube publication depending on target audience and goals of the specific media
- Interviewed content producers and managers to determine the organization's system's needs. After comparing the features offered my many open source, non-commercial and commercial solutions (Drupal, ExpressionEngine, Final Site, Systems Alliance, Sylvia, and more...), found Plone to be the most compatible and usable for Salem's needs.
- Created data migration scripts to export from Joomla that translated site-intrinsic assets (images and internal links in the article content) to search engine optimized (SEO) URIs based on the Joomla menu hierarchy, falling back on Section and Category where appropriate. This automated roughly 90% of the data migration of the over 1,600 articles and vastly expedited the migration.
- Enhanced the ZipFileImport plugin for Plone to import Core (most of the Dublin Core) metadata during import when provided. This allows for import to include: Title, Description, Subject(s), Creation Date, Publication Date, Expiration Date, and Include/Exclude from navigation.
- Optimized search engine effectiveness by migrating to SEO URLs and Google listing maintenance operations using Google's Webmaster Tools.
- Repaired/cleaned/removed previous website hacking and optimized robots.txt file to reduce the visibility to would-be hackers using Google and other search engines as a tool for discovering potential vulnerabilities. I worked closely with the server administrators to include counter-measures to secure website against future attacks.

### North American Realty Services, Inc.
#### Systems Engineer, Programmer (02/03 -06/08)

- Designed and implemented a custom solution for Trust Document creation based on a flexible variable dataset.

- Originally used the work from Trinil, Inc. to realize a production system that was in daily use by the company for 5 years.
- This was the premier application of the simultaneous work for Trinil, Inc. I became the only maintainer of the Trinil code and modified and enhanced the code to suit NARS' needs.
- When Trinil folded, NARS migrated to PHP and I lead the team in creating the next generation application to ensure that all the technical and business discoveries made throughout my time were not lost, saving the company valuable time in defining the replacement application.

### Trinil, Inc.
#### Programmer (9/01 -02/05)

- Worked directly under technical lead to develop a proprietary Symmetric Object Oriented Distributed Data Base using Java RMI.
- Created JSP Tag Library to automate data display and form field creation. This was created to give logical access to any data structure with a staging step for the data to be validated before it was committed to the database.
- Created Java Object to SQL storage automation to store any object structure to any database (though only implemented for PostgreSQL).
- Created wrapper layer that would Òpush downÓ a query to the underlying SQL database for search speed.
- Created asynchronous database commits to aid in application performance. This enabled the in-use objects to stay available via smart caching, while keeping transactions safe from data loss.
- Created a multiple document interface in Java Swing that gave advanced, secure and flexible access to the remote repository. Menu items, editing tabs and available actions were automatically registered to object types for ÒsmartÓ editing of objects.

- In addition to my contributions in object/database design and application lifecycle management, I was leading the way in the Research and Development for the future of the company's technical direction, including employing IBM's SanFrancisco, J2EE technologies (JNDI, EJB, JMS) and making recommendations based on my experience with the products and the needs of the company.
- As well as setting up the plumbing for a successful programming environment and laying down the foundation for the technical direction/future of the company, I helped train the team of programmers in OOP techniques and practices including Object Patterns, general rules of encapsulation, abstraction and interface design and implementation.

### Dotster SDK
