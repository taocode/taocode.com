October 10, 2022 â€” it's been a while since I implemented my 2 step program for health. So... *how's it going?*

## Exercise everyday - *Mixed* 

After maintaining 6 workouts a weeek of 30+ minutes, I found it to be a bit too much. I now aim for 2-3 upper-body strength workouts per week, circuit style using suspension straps. I ride EUC most everyday for about an hour. I take stretch breaks throughout the day and use a sit/stand desk during work, sometimes seated on a balance ball.

### Electric Unicycle Dreams

I've ridden over 3,000 miles on an <abbr title="Electric Unicycle">EUC</abbr> this year; it isn't exactly a *cardio workout* but it also isn't exactly doing nothing. Riding with an HR monitor, I'm typically between 85-110, often under 100 BPM. On extended offroad trails my HR can peak around 160 BPM. 

#### Core & Leg Training

EUC riding requires balance and an active stance with at least a slight bend to the knees. All in all, my core from abs to hips get used to carve and stabilize across bumpy terrain.

## 2) Fasting Overnight

*After the first 3 months,* fasting overnight has generally been easy to maintain. There's a rare exception to this rule but I still find it fairly easy to not eat for more than 12 hours a night.

## Results

***I've maintained my weight.*** I've generally weighed the same for over a year even with the workout plan changes.

### Sit-Stand Desk

I am looking for a tilting stool to have an option between sitting and standing. I hardly remember being trapped in my chair to work and shift a few times per day from standing to sitting on a balance ball or chair.

## My Suspension Strap (TRX) Workout

I find it helpful to move my feet away from or towards the suspension point to decrease or increase muscle load, respectively. This is most pronounced in the chest Fly because I like to get a stretch in at the top of the motion but it can put a dangerous amount of load on your shoulders, in particular the rotator cuff tendon. So I step into the stretch, lightening the load. I do this to lesser degrees on other exercises

1. **Push-Ups** - on floor with grip handles, focus on pushing hands towards each other)
1. **Back Row** - full range, from face/head to kidneys
1. **Chest Press** - full range, pushing up for upper chest, middle and low angle
1. **Torso Twist** - facing suspension point
1. **Chest Fly** - move arms along multiple angles for even muscle fatigue
1. **Back Fly** - move along multiple angles from narrow, tall Y to a low T
1. **Power Pull** - staggered descending repetition: 3 left, 3 right, 2 left, 2 right, ...
1. **Triceps Extension** - from above head "hammer toss" and from the ears/shoulders
1. **Bicep Curl** - from separate with wrists rotated in to out to clutched together

I perform each exercise for ~1 minute and move directly to the next with no break. The routine is designed to allow the most recently used muscle to recover. I usually repeat the routine twice but sometimes I'll add a 3rd, bonus round.

The suspension straps have provided me a few hundred upper body workouts. They're relatively cheap, lightweight, easy to travel with and can provide resistance at a variety of angles and loads based on foot placement.

### Suspension Straps Don't Have Numbers

Using freeweights you can easily say *"I bench press 200 pounds"* but using suspension straps has no such simplistic goal. **Why's that good?** *Because,* I cannot compare nor compete with a number. It's not that numbers are bad but without numbers it's all about how it feels. Too much load? Lighten it. Too easy? Step toward the suspension point. It becomes almost a dance with the goal of tiring specific muscles.
