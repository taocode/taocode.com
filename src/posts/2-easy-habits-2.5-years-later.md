October 01, 2022 â€” it's been a while since I implemented my 2 step program for health. So... *how's it going?*

## 1) Exercise everyday - *Mixed* 

After maintaining 6 workouts a weeek of 30+ minutes, I found it to be a bit too much. I now aim for 2-3 upper-body strength workouts per week, circuit style using suspension straps. I ride EUC most everyday for about an hour. I take stretch breaks throughout the day and use a sit/stand desk during work, sometimes seated on a balance ball.

Far more exciting: [I can ride an electric unicycle!](/blog/why-i-love-to-ride-eucs). Read about it there but know that I ride an average of an hour everyday, sometimes more.

### My TRX/Suspension Strap Workout

I find it helpful to move my feet away from or towards the suspension point to decrease or increase muscle load, respectively. This is most pronounced in the chest Fly because I like to get a stretch in at the top of the motion but it can put a dangerous amount of load on your shoulders, in particular the rotator cuff tendon. So I step into the stretch, lightening the load. I do this to lesser degrees on other exercises

1. **Push-Ups** - on floor with grip handles, focus on pushing hands towards each other)
1. **Back Row** - full range, from face/head to kidneys
1. **Chest Press** - full range, pushing up for upper chest, middle and low angle
1. **Torso Twist** - facing suspension point
1. **Chest Fly** - move arms along multiple angles for even muscle fatigue
1. **Back Fly** - move along multiple angles from narrow, tall Y to a low T
1. **Power Pull** - staggered descending repetition: 3 left, 3 right, 2 left, 2 right, ...
1. **Triceps Extension** - from above head "hammer toss" and from the ears/shoulders
1. **Bicep Curl** - from separate with wrists rotated in to out to clutched together

I perform each exercise for ~1 minute and move directly to the next with no break. The routine is designed to allow the most recently used muscle to recover. I usually repeat the routine twice but sometimes I'll add a 3rd, bonus round.

The suspension straps have provided me a few hundred upper body workouts. They're relatively cheap, lightweight, easy to travel with and can provide resistance at a variety of angles and loads based on foot placement.

### Suspension Straps Don't Have Numbers

Using freeweights you can easily say *"I bench press 200 pounds"* but using suspension straps has no such simplistic goal. **Why's that good?** *Because,* I cannot compare nor compete with a number. It's not that numbers are bad but without numbers it's all about how it feels. Too much load? Lighten it. Too easy? Step toward the suspension point. It becomes almost a dance with the goal of tiring specific muscles.

### Sit-Stand Desk

Something I may underestimate is the fact that I no longer sit stagnant all day at my desk. I move from standing to seated in a chair or on a balance ball throughout my day. This encourages light stretching and body awareness even while coding.

I am looking for a tilting stool to have an option between sitting and standing. I hardly remember being trapped in my chair to work anymore. I tire of standing or of sitting and change. It turns out that we should generally not just be standing but moving, at least some throughout our days. Resting and sitting is also fine and necessary, it's more a problem of doing too much of any 1 of them.

## 2) Fasting Overnight

*After the first 3 months,* fasting overnight has generally been easy to maintain. There's a rare exception to this rule but I still find it fairly easy to not eat for more than 12 hours a night.

## Results

***I've maintained my weight.*** I've generally weighed the same for over a year even with the workout plan changes.
