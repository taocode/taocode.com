excerpt: 'In gratitude for others that have shared useful ideas and solutions.'
lead: I doubt I'll ever realize just how much I've gained from others sharing what they've learned or created. I made this blog to share some notes on things I've learned, especially around making web sites.

## A Deeper Explanation

I hope to share my ideas effectively and help you get to useful solutions quickly. I'm often finding answers on stackoverflow and the self-service/self-help sites often including other bloggers like me, sharing their expertise.

Partly, I'll have some solutions here that I may want to refer back to, a notes journal for my own reference, just publicly available so that others may find useful.

## Irregular by Nature

Posts will come as I have relevant information to share and in their own organic timeline. I'd previously considered something like this but I did not like the various platforms I've tried to produce it. Although my effort in producing this blog is for sharing knowledge, there's no *release schedule* and the *content strategy* is simply quality writing on interesting subjects or *hard-to-solve* problems.

## General Topics

- Programming; especially JavaScript - Node and App making, and PHP or Go/Hugo, the things I use to produce web sites and topics I want to learn more about.
- My portfolio; a showcase of things I've produced with notes that may be valuable to others.
- Art and animation; I find delight in creating animated SVGs and nice CSS transitions.
- Other related or unrelated topics

## Document Findings, Share Insight

After I've searched a dozen times and have determined that whatever I've learned hasn't yet be captured in a conclusive way, I'll put my notes up here; this is largely for myself. Could I use Google Docs or similar? Yes, of course, but then it wouldn't be as beautiful nor something that I can trick out anyway I like.

## My Main Hustle

Coding websites, themes, CMS, CDN, etc... has been my main source of income, my main hustle, instead of a side-hustle. I like programming and improving projects and deliverables. 

## Side Hustle

For a side hustle, check out [MarkJonesVoice](https://markjonesvoice.com/). I'd love to read a script for your production, though I totally get that thes cross-over between a programmer's blog and voice over actor is maybe a bit of a stretch.

## Know the name: TAOCode

I've sat on this domain for a long time. Perhaps a project worthy of the name will emerge and provide a future gig for me. I mean, it seems like The Art of Code should maybe be an Oracle or Dev.to or something special. It begins by me putting what I can into it and seeing where this effort takes me.

After all, I code websites for other people all the time, but like the landscaper, my own was a bit neglected for a number of years. I hope you find this site so useful that you think: "we should hire the taocode guy".
