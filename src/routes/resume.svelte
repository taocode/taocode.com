    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a thoughtful nerd that is continually problem solving and looking for improvements. I’m well versed in all parts of web development and can work with multiple languages, platforms and back-ends to produce robust, optimized sites. I’ve developed websites for over two dozen years beginning with NT 3.51 and ASP using VBScript. I'm a tenacious debugger and analyze project needs to create elegant, forward-thinking solutions. Beyond programming, I have a broad variety of web-relevant skills including deep CSS familiarity and know how to make a performant website. I consider myself a good fit for a position that requires a flexible, agile programmer/fixer.</p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Excellent verbal and written communication communication</li>
    <li>Over 2 decades of direct experience developing websites including:<br>
      Platform migrations, XML/XSLT, CSS3, HTML5, CFML, PHP and more
      </li>
    <li>
      Extensive experience with several programming languages and application platforms:<br>
      Node.js, PHP, Python, JavaScript, Java, XSLT, Visual Basic, VB Script, UML, SQL, and noSQL

    </ul>
    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <h3>Salem Academy and College<br></h3>
    <h4>Webmaster, Migration Specialist (10/08 -Present)</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Maintained and enhanced www.salem.edu and     www.salemacademy.com</li>
    <li>Used ClickHeat and Google AdSense to analyze the multiple     dimensions of the site's usability and online presence. Using     these tools we were able to gain the insight into what worked     and what didn't. In the end we improved time spent on site by     20% and dropped the bounce rate by nearly 15%.</li>
    <li>Streamlined online media delivery including work with Flash     Video and YouTube publication depending on target audience and     goals of the specific media</li>
    <li>Interviewed content producers and managers to determine the     organization's system's needs. After comparing the features     offered my many open source, non-commercial and commercial     solutions (Drupal, ExpressionEngine, Final Site, Systems     Alliance, Sylvia, and more...), found Plone to be the most     compatible and usable for Salem's needs.</li>
    <li>Created data migration scripts to export from Joomla that     translated site-intrinsic assets (images and internal links in     the article content) to search engine optimized (SEO) URIs     based on the Joomla menu hierarchy, falling back on Section and     Category where appropriate. This automated roughly 90% of the     data migration of the over 1,600 articles and vastly expedited     the migration.</li>
    <li>Enhanced the ZipFileImport plugin for Plone to import Core     (most of the Dublin Core) metadata during import when provided.     This allows for import to include: Title, Description,     Subject(s), Creation Date, Publication Date, Expiration Date,     and Include/Exclude from navigation.</li>
    <li>Optimized search engine effectiveness by migrating to SEO     URLs and Google listing maintenance operations using Google's     Webmaster Tools.</li>
    <li>Repaired/cleaned/removed previous website hacking and     optimized robots.txt file to reduce the visibility to would-be     hackers using Google and other search engines as a tool for     discovering potential vulnerabilities. I worked closely with     the server administrators to include counter-measures to secure     website against future attacks.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>North American Realty Services, Inc.</h3>
    <h4>Systems Engineer, Programmer (02/03 -06/08)</h4>

    <li>Designed and implemented a custom solution for Trust     Document creation based on a flexible variable dataset.</li>
    <li>Worked closely with staff to provide technical solutions     for the business needs.</li>
    <li>High quality print documents were originally created using     RTF based on Microsoft Word generated documents, but later we     migrated to PDF using Flyer Saucer's XHTML/CSS2 rendering     engine.</li>
    <li>Originally used the work from Trinil, Inc. to realize a     production system that was in daily use by the company for 5     years.</li>

    <li>When Trinil folded, NARS migrated to PHP and I lead the     team in creating the next generation application to ensure that     all the technical and business discoveries made throughout my     time were not lost, saving the company valuable time in     defining the replacement application.</li>

    <li>Created a multiple document interface in Java Swing that     gave advanced, secure and flexible access to the remote     repository. Menu items, editing tabs and available actions were     automatically registered to object types for     ÒsmartÓ editing of objects.</li>
