    According to the Ordinance on Online Dispute Resolution in Consumer Matters
    (ODR Ordinance) we would like to inform you about the Online Dispute
    Resolution Platform (OS Platform).

  <p>
    Consumers have the possibility to submit complaints to the Online Dispute
    Resolution Platform of the European Commission at
