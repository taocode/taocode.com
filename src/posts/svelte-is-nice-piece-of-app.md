I'm impatient. I want things to run fast enough that I don't have time to wonder *what's taking so long?*

After all, if it's just a few pages, why would it take nearly 10 minutes to build? 

### Laziness Rules (CSS Edition)

I'm lazy and don't want to have to come up with semantic CSS names. I know there are fans of BEM style CSS but for me, Tailwind provides just the right amount of style and standard names.

### What Apps/SSGs have I sampled?

- Gatsby<br>
  I never got Gatsby set up properly. I tried. It was slow to start even before adding Tailwind. I moved on.
- 11ty<br>
  I wanted to love 11ty but it was slower than Hugo to build and troubling
