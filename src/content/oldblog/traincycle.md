This is one of the larger static sites I've developed. It builds in under 1 minute with TailwindCSS compilation taking up the majority of the time. 

Beyond Hugo, I created the rotating cog animation including figuring out a functional tooth count and rotation rate to create the illusion of cogs rotating against each other.
