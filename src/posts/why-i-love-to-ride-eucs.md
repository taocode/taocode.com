October 10, 2022 â€” With nearly 10 months of riding and well over 3,000 miles of mixed street and offroad riding, *what's it like?*

## Riding an EUC *is Stupid Fun!*

It's a magical vehicle that *"reads your mind"* (by responding to your body position). It's *even more fun* with *more experience!* I've put in a lot of offroad time which has helped me become a better rider at lower speeds and helps me stay with the wheel over bumpy offroad trais and rough streets. There are some smooth surfaces but generally roads have at least some ruts and bumps so it is a necessary skill.

## Invisible Vehicle *from the Rider's Perspective*

Perhaps the most mind-bending aspect of riding an EUC is the lack of visual reference to the vehicle you're riding. On a bike or scooter you see your arms and hands holding the handlebars in your field of view. With an EUC or other self-powered, self-balancing devices like hoverboards and OneWheels, you're just there, magically rolling down the road or trail.

## Is Riding an EUC *Difficult?*

It absolutely requires training and practice. I acquired the basics in about a half hour but it took many days to get better at turning and months to get comfortable with bumpy and offroad riding.

I still can't go backwards and have only ridden in the standing position *(not seated)*. I probably can ride with 1 leg on a controlled surface but haven't really tried; I've gotten better at adjusting my feet on the pedals while riding which is sort of a baby step in this direction.

It's incredibly rewarding to ride. For the effort I put in, I get back so much more than simple transportation.

## Training on an EUC *is Fun!*

I've enjoyed the entire learning experience, even those shaky, early days. While it takes training to ride comfortably over multiple terrains, you can take it step by step, skill by skill. Just make the next offroad a little quicker or bumpier. When I revisit terrain that I initially struggled to go over, I'm generally amuzed by how easy has become.

## Cool, cool, but ... *What About Injuries?*

I've had a few minor bruises from some low-speed falls, generally offroad hitting a hole or a ditch where I couldn't keep the wheel under me. So most of my falls have been on grass and the vast majority of my accidents are under 5 MPH.

My left elbow got a raspberry from an early crash and failure of my safety equipment and was bruised again because I missed the elbow pad in the jacket on another fall. My fingers got scraped up and there's been various bruising in calves where they contact the vehicle early on but nothing major.

## Is Riding an EUC *Exercise?*

It isn't exactly a *cardio workout* but it also isn't exactly doing nothing. I'm typically between 85&#8209;110 BPM but on extended offroad trails my HR can peak at ~160 BPM.

### Core & Leg Training

EUC riding requires balance and an active stance with at least a slight bend to the knees. All in all, my core from abs to hips get used to carve and stabilize across bumpy terrain.

Calf, hip and hamstring stretches become very meaningful and helpful.

### Knee Injury

I hurt my right knee at age 11 when I slipped and the ensuing injury has left scar tissue and what's been identified as a ganglion cyst. Occassionally, usually weather dependent, I experience pain and soreness at and near the injury.

Since riding an EUC, I've only experienced 1 medium intense flare-up. I expect this is because I'm strengthening all of the connective tissue and muscles while being magically transported around town.
