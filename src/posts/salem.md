Managing the public facing sites for salem.edu and salemacademy.com has been my main job since 2008.

I've used many systems over the years from Joomla, Plone, and Cascade Server to Drupl, WordPress and ConcreteCMS.

## Tech Stack

- Drupal for many sites
- ConcreteCMS for salemacademy.com
- Gulp for theme task running
- SASS/SCSS for theme
