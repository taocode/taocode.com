October 10, 2022 â€” With nearly 10 months of riding and well over 3,000 miles of mixed street and offroad riding, *what's it like?*

## Electric Unicycle Dreams

More than the workout, *riding an EUC is stupid fun.* It's a magical vehicle that *"reads your mind"* (by responding to your body position). It's *even more fun* with *more experience!* I've put in a lot of offroad time which has helped me become a better rider at lower speeds which helps with rough street conditions. There are some smooth surfaces but generally roads have ruts and bumps.

### Is Riding an EUC *Exercise?*

It isn't exactly a *cardio workout* but it also isn't exactly doing nothing. I'm typically between 85&#8209;110 BPM but on extended offroad trails my HR can peak at ~160 BPM.


### Invisible Vehicle

Perhaps the most mind-bending aspect of riding an EUC is the lack of visual reference to the vehicle you're riding. On a bike or scooter you see your arms and hands holding the handlebars in your field of view. With an EUC or other self-balancing devices like hoverboards and OneWheels, you're just there, magically rolling down the road or trail.

### Core & Leg Training

EUC riding requires balance and an active stance with at least a slight bend to the knees. All in all, my core from abs to hips get used to carve and stabilize across bumpy terrain.

### Knee Injury

I hurt my right knee at age 11 when I slipped and the ensuing injury has left scar tissue and what's been identified as a ganglion cyst. Occassionally, usually weather dependent, I experience pain and soreness at and near the injury.

Since riding an EUC, this pain has only had 1 pain flare-up.
