Less than 6 months since I started this [new site using Svelte with Routify](/blog/new-site), I've upgraded to SvelteKit and a new codebase, [thanks to Markus Hatvan](#thanks-markus-hatvan) for sharing his site's code.

## Why?

I wanted to be able to tag my content so it could navigated by subject or category. I didn't spend enough time to figure out how to do that with the prior Routify+Vite build. Plus, I get to work with SvelteKit, the shiny new code with official Svelte routing.

I initially chose Routify simply because the starter package from Reepolee worked and it was **fast**! Development startup in roughly 10 seconds and builds in a similar amount of time on my local system. Svite indeed!

## A Better Build

On GitHub I came across Markus' SvelteKit + Tailwind build and saw that he already had functioning tags and categories and it was on SvelteKit. Perfect! So I started a new version of the site build based on it.
